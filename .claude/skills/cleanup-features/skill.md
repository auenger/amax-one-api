# Skill: cleanup-features

Detect and clean up orphaned worktrees, missing references, and inconsistent state.

## Usage

```
/cleanup-features              # Check and prompt for cleanup
/cleanup-features --auto       # Automatically clean up
/cleanup-features --dry-run    # Show what would be cleaned
```

## What It Checks

1. **Orphaned Worktrees**: Worktrees that exist but aren't in queue.yaml
2. **Missing Worktrees**: Worktrees recorded in queue.yaml but don't exist
3. **Orphaned Directories**: Feature directories not in queue.yaml
4. **Missing Directories**: Features in queue.yaml but directory doesn't exist

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Collect Information

```bash
# Get recorded worktrees from queue.yaml
# Get actual worktrees: git worktree list
# Scan features/ directory
```

### Step 2: Detect Anomalies

Compare recorded vs actual:
- `orphaned_worktrees` = actual - recorded
- `missing_worktrees` = recorded - actual
- `orphaned_dirs` = actual dirs - recorded
- `missing_dirs` = recorded - actual dirs

### Step 3: Display Results

If no issues: show "Everything is clean" with counts.

If issues found: list each issue with suggested action, prompt user for confirmation.

### Step 4: Execute Cleanup

Based on user selection (or --auto), perform cleanup actions.

## Cleanup Actions

| Issue | Action Options |
|-------|---------------|
| Orphaned worktree | Delete / Keep and add to queue |
| Missing worktree | Remove from queue / Mark for repair |
| Orphaned pending-* | Archive / Delete / Add to queue |
| Orphaned active-* | Archive / Delete / Check worktree |

## Output

### Dry Run
```
Dry Run - Actions that would be executed:

[DELETE] git worktree remove {orphaned_worktree_path}
[UPDATE] queue.yaml: remove {id} worktree reference
[MOVE] active-{id} -> archive/

Run without --dry-run to execute.
```

### Cleanup Complete
```
Cleanup complete

- Deleted 1 orphaned worktree
- Fixed 1 missing worktree reference
- Archived 1 orphaned directory
```

## Error Codes

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| GIT_ERROR | Git operation failed |
| PERMISSION_ERROR | Cannot delete files |

## Notes

1. Always use --dry-run first to preview changes
2. Deletion is irreversible
3. Run /list-features after cleanup to verify state
