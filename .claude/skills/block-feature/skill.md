# Skill: block-feature

Block a feature from being automatically scheduled. Use when waiting for dependencies or external factors.

## Usage

```
/block-feature <feature-id> [reason]
```

Parameters:
- `feature-id`: The feature ID (required)
- `reason`: Why it's being blocked (optional, default: "Manually blocked")

## Pre-flight Checks

- Feature must be in `pending` or `blocked` list in `feature-workflow/queue.yaml`
- Cannot block `active` features

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Check Feature Status

Find the feature in `queue.yaml`:
- If in `active`: Return error (cannot block active features)
- If already in `blocked`: Update the reason
- If in `pending`: Proceed to block

### Step 2: Update Queue

Move from `pending` to `blocked` in `queue.yaml`:
```yaml
blocked:
  - id: {id}
    name: {name}
    reason: "{reason}"
    created: {original_created}
```

Update `meta.last_updated`.

## Output

### Success
```
Feature {id} blocked

Reason: {reason}

Unblock: /unblock-feature {id}
```

### Error - Cannot Block Active
```
Cannot block active feature {id}

The feature is currently in development.
Complete or abandon it first:
  /complete-feature {id}
```

## Error Codes

| Code | Description | Solution |
|------|-------------|----------|
| NOT_FOUND | Feature doesn't exist | Check ID |
| CANNOT_BLOCK_ACTIVE | Feature is active | Complete or abandon first |
| ALREADY_BLOCKED | Already blocked | Reason updated |
