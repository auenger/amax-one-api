# Skill: unblock-feature

Unblock a feature and return it to the pending queue for scheduling.

## Usage

```
/unblock-feature <feature-id>
```

## Pre-flight Checks

- Feature must be in `blocked` list in `feature-workflow/queue.yaml`

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Check Feature Status

Find the feature in `queue.yaml` `blocked` list. If not found, return error.

### Step 2: Update Queue

Move from `blocked` to `pending` in `queue.yaml`:
- Remove from `blocked`
- Add to `pending` with original priority
- Sort `pending` by priority (descending)
- Update `meta.last_updated`

### Step 3: Check Auto-Start

If `feature-workflow/config.yaml` `workflow.auto_start: true`:
- Check if there's an available slot
- If this feature is highest priority: call `start-feature`

## Output

### Success - Pending
```
Feature {id} unblocked

Status: pending (waiting to be scheduled)
Position in queue: #{position} (priority {priority})
```

### Success - Auto-Started
```
Feature {id} unblocked

Auto-started! (highest priority, slot available)
cd {worktree_path}
```

### Error
```
Feature {id} is not blocked

Use /list-features to see current status.
```

## Error Codes

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| NOT_FOUND | Feature doesn't exist |
| NOT_BLOCKED | Feature is not in blocked list |
